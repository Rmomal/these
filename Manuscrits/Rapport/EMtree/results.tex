\subsubsection{Effect of dataset dimensions}
\label{adverse}

Behaviors are compared on an easy setting ($n=100$, $p=20$) and a hard setting ($n=50$, $p=30$). Fig.~\ref{TPFN} displays FDR and density ratio measures for all methods on the different cases.  Detailed values of medians and standard-deviations are given in Tables \ref{medFDR} and \ref{meddens} in appendix. The behaviour of methods remains virtually the same across Erdös and Cluster structures. Scale-free structure appears to entail a greater difficulty for all methods with median FDR above $75\%$, except for EMtree which stays at $30\%$ in the hard setting. These poor performance are due to the inferred networks being too dense compared to the original Scale-free graphs. Another experiment with the Scale-free structure is detailed in Fig.~\ref{SF50}, where the number of species is fixed to $50$, and the number of samples is $100$ or $50$.  Under such setting the behavior of ecoCopula and MRFcov greatly improves with FDR at about $30\%$, where EMtree shows about $40\%$ in median (detailed values available in Table~\ref{perfSF50} in appendix).\\
The greater difficulty affects all methods. Density ratios either increase (MInt, SpiecEasi) or decrease (gCoda, ecoCopula, MRFcov). In the first case, FDRs tend to increase as well (e.g. $40\%$ increase for MInt in Erdös and Cluster structures), where a decrease in density ratio yields more empty results (e.g. in Table \ref{empty} $25\%$ of empty graphs for ecoCopula with  Erdös and Cluster structures, $15\%$ with Scale-free structures for $p$ fixed to $50$). EMtree seems to remain stable as for the density ratio, however it shows an increase in FDR measures of about $20\%$ for all structures.


Considering FDRs and density ratios combined, EMtree appears to be the method with the lower FDR which maintains a density ratio reasonably close to 1. As a consequence, the proposed methodology compares well to existing tools on problems with varying difficulties. EMtree is also comparable on running times. Table~\ref{timesTPFN} shows that for Erdös and Cluster it is the third quicker method in easy cases and the second in hard ones. Table \ref{timeSF} (in appendix) shows that on hard scale-free problems ($p=30$ and $p=50$ with $n=50$) EMtree is the quicker method, and third otherwise.

Interestingly, in easy cases when the network density is well estimated, methods yield FDR of $10\%-30\%$ in median. This reminds that network inference from abundance data is a difficult task, and that perfect inference of the network remains an out-of-reach goal.

\subsubsection{Effect of network structure}

As expected for a fixed $p$, the higher the number of observations $n$, the better the performance for all methods and structures. Interestingly, the same happens when $p$ increases for a fixed $n=100$ (except for SpiecEasi).
EMtree performs well on Scale-free structures (Fig.~\ref{SFAUC}) which was also expected; the other methods performance worsen compared to other structures. When lowering $n$ to 30, EMtree performance deteriorates along with $p$, yet remaining above $70\%$ in median in the extreme case where $p=n$ (Fig.~\ref{SFAUC}, right). The structure being Erdös or Cluster, each method is affected in the same way by an increase of $n$ or $p$ (Fig.~\ref{panelErdClust}). Besides, increasing the difference between the two structures by tuning up the \textit{ratio} parameter has no effect. Overall EMtree performs better than gCoda and SpiecEasi on all the studied configurations. Running times are summarized in Table~\ref{timeNP}. EMtree is about 10 times slower than gCoda (4 for small $n$), and 4 times faster than SpiecEasi. The high standard deviation for small $n$ seems to be due to gCoda struggling with Scale-free structures.

\subsubsection{Effect of network density}
The comparison of top and bottom panels of Fig.~\ref{panelErdClust} shows that network inference gets harder as the network gets denser, whatever the method and the structure of the true graph. Running times are not affected (Table \ref{timeDenser}).
Fig.~\ref{varyDens} shows that EMtree performance does not deteriorate faster than that of other methods, demonstrating that the tree hypothesis is not a limitation.
